## Introduction to Python

#### 01.Calculating Population Change Over Time

You work at the UN in urban planning and are interested in tracking population growth across major metropolitan regions. You are hoping that by looking at historical population numbers that you can predict future growth and help your team make decisions about resourcing.

Use what you’ve learned about the basics of Python to calculate the population growth of Istanbul and print out a short report.

## Graphing in Python

#### 02.Sublime Limes' Line Graphs

In this project, you will be acting as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. Using **Matplotlib**, you’ll create some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively.
